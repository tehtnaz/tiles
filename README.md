# tiles

my own simple library of functions for drawing a set of tiles using raylib

i remake this for the languages i want to test  

for c, make sure to add include folder with raylib 4.2, raymath 1.5, rlgl 4.0

required packages for python script:
- raylib
- multipledispatch

for zig, add external git repos
- `git submodule update --init --recursive`

for go, download raylib-go to vendor
